This is the simulation codes in Matlab for the paper titled "Resource Competition-Driven Bistability and Stochastic Switching Amplify Gene Expression Noise". 

The data from the stochastic simulation for Figs. 2 and 4 are too large to be uploaded here but it can been easily generated by running the code.
